## Document structure and output

(@) Quarto uses `embed-resources: true` in the yaml heading so that the document is a single file with no external dependencies
(@) Quarto compiles without errors and warnings
(@) All outputs render: no broken figures, tables
(@) All citations and bibliography entries appear without breaking, are formatted correctly, and links function as expected
(@) All internal links and references (e.g. Table X, Figure Y, Section Z) work and point to the right content


## Statistical and analytical integrity

(@) All text has been run through the [statcheck](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/statcheck/index.html) package, to determine if reported p-values, df, and test statistics align. Any errors or decision errors have been resolved.
(@) All tests have effect sizes reported.
(@) Confidence intervals are included around point estimates.
(@) Data visualizations and text/data/statistics match (e.g. means in the text match the means in the visualization)

## Reproducibility

(@) Quarto project structure follows OEDA standards (TBD: e.g., report.qmd, figures/, data/, scripts/) for transparency.
(@) Document makes use of a reproducible environment (TBD: determine the OEDA standard: Docker, renv.lock, etc.?)
(@) Seeds are set for simulations, resampling, bootstrapping, or other random processes
(@) Scripts and data used in the document are versioned and reproducible
(@) Code chunks use `#| eval: true` unless intentionally disabled with a comment as to why
(@) Input data is described or linked clearly (e.g. source, format, preprocessing). Data are all versioned instances, not SQL pulls from  "live" administrative data.

## Interpretibility and clarity

(@) Title reflects key findings, variables, populations, and time periods
(@) Abstract reflects key findings, variables, populations, and time periods
(@) Key findings are clearly stated in plain language
(@) The main message is consistent across the title, abstract, results, visualizations, and conclusion
(@) Effects are described in units meaningful to the audience (counts of individuals, dollars, days in care, etc.)
(@) Acronyms and technical terms are minimal, and are defined at first use
(@) Assumptions and limitations are acknowledged as appropriate in introduction, methods, and conclusions, and are addressed in suggestions for future work
(@) Figures and tables are interpretable without reference to the text

## Writing quality style

(@) No placeholder text (ADD, TODO, etc.) remains
(@) Grammar, spelling, and punctuation are correct
(@) Voice and tense are consistent
(@) Readability scores have been calculated and are within OEDA adopted thresholds
(@) Terminology and variable names are consistent throughout


## Ethical, legal, and confidentiality checks

(@) No confidential or identifying information is used in any data input
(@) No confidential or identifying information appears in any output (text, visualization, table, etc.)
(@) Appropriate masking is used for all static elements
(@) Appropriate masking has been tested for with any dynamic elements
(@) All data use complies with licenses, access conditions, and consent
(@) Ethics approval, DUA, IAA, etc. are acknowledged if applicable
