Specifically mentioned in the policy are coworkers within ODHS and OHA.\n\n\nSame-or-next business day: Acknowledge the bid for interaction\nAll interactions–phone call, voice mail, email, instant message, text–should be acknowledged within one-business day. I believe this should also include submissions to request forms.\nIf the one-day response does is not intended to resolve the customer’s issue, the acknowledgement could be\n\nAn auto-reply indicating planned leave, including expected date of return and alternative contacts\nA personal response requesting additional information\nA personal response providing additional information\nA personal response referring the customer to another person, process, or resource\nA personal response with a timeline for future responses to resolve the issue\n\n\n\nWithin 5 business days: Follow up with a plan for resolution\nIf you will not be resolving the request straight away, within 5 business days of the interaction, share plans with the customer with anticipated timelines for completion of the response.\n\n\nWithin 15 or 30 days: Resolution of the interaction\nIn the absence of legislation, rule, policy, CBA, or established processes (like procurement), the policy sets expectations that\n\nMost interactions are complete within 15 business days\nAlmost all interactions are complete within 30 business days\n\n\n\nAdditional expectations\n\nProvide routine status updated when completion timelines are projected to be longer than 30 days\nProvide customers information about current expected timelines, given the amount of work requested, current workloads, and capacity\nProvide customers with links to a webpage with standard timelines, and any current systemic issues impacting likely timelines"

I have not been able to determine just how the publications office creates their tints, so the tints output from this function do not exactly match the tints displayed in the publication guide.\n\n#' Create a tint of a base color\n#'\n#' This function generates a tint by mixing a base hex color with white in the HSL\n#' (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color space. This method is perceptually more\n#' uniform than mixing in RGB space. tint_percent = 100 should return the base_hex.\n#' tint_percent = 0 should return pure white (\"#FFFFFF\").\n#'\n#' @param base_hex A character string of the starting hex color (e.g., \"#2E3192\").\n#' @param tint_percent A numeric value from 0 to 100 representing the\n#'   percentage of the original color to retain. A value of 80 creates a tint \n#'   which is 80 parts the base color and 20 parts pure white.\n#'   \n#' @return A character string for the new hex color.\n#' @export\n\n\ncreate_tint &lt;- function(base_hex, tint_percent) {\n  \n  pct_white &lt;- (100 - tint_percent) / 100\n  \n  hsl_start &lt;- plotwidgets::col2hsl(base_hex)\n  hsl_end &lt;- hsl_start\n  hsl_end[3] &lt;- ((1 - hsl_start[3]) * pct_white) + hsl_start[3]\n  \n  col_end &lt;- plotwidgets::hsl2col(hsl_end)\n  \n  return(col_end)\n}\n\n\nExamples of North Star Indigo tints\n\nlapply(seq(100,0,-20), function(x) create_tint(OEDA_colors$northstar, x)) |&gt; \n  unlist() |&gt; \n  as_tibble() |&gt;\n  mutate(x = row_number()) |&gt; \n  mutate(y = 1) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_identity()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Forest Green tints\n\nlapply(seq(100,0,-20), function(x) create_tint(OEDA_colors$forest, x)) |&gt; \n  unlist() |&gt; \n  as_tibble() |&gt;\n  mutate(x = row_number()) |&gt; \n  mutate(y = 1) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_identity()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Desert Sand tints\n\nlapply(c(100, 70, 30), function(x) create_tint(OEDA_colors$desert, x)) |&gt; \n  unlist() |&gt; \n  as_tibble() |&gt;\n  mutate(x = row_number()) |&gt; \n  mutate(y = 1) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  aes(x = x, y = y, fill = value) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_identity()",
