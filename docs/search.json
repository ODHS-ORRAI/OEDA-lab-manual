    "text": "Ideation\nIdeas can come from anywhere. There may be suggestions, requests, or questions voiced in Advisory Council meetings. Researchers may review academic or think tank literature. Agency researchers and subject matter experts may meet with OEDA researchers and discuss ideas. And so on.\nWhen OEDA researchers encounter ideas they work with subject matter experts to create a proposal. Proposals should be relatively quick and easy, requiring just a meeting or two and a few hours of researchers’ time to draft. Much will still be unknown about the practicality, importance, and relevance of the proposed idea. Clarity on those will emerge with the process below.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  b1@{ shape: stadium, label: 'Idea' }\n  b2@{ shape: rect, label: 'OEDA Ideation Unit' }\n  b3@{ shape: procs, label: 'Agency SMEs' }\n  b4@{ shape: doc, label: 'Proposal' }\n  \n  b1 --&gt; b2 --&gt; b3 --&gt; b4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvisory Council Meeting\nOEDA researchers or the OEDA manager bring proposals to the council. The council members ask clarifying questions about the proposal and perhaps makes suggestions to improve its potential. The council scores the proposal on criteria related to its importance to state government, potential impacts, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  c1@{ shape: doc, label: 'Proposal' }\n  c2@{ shape: rect, label: 'Advisory Council' }\n  c3@{ shape: doc, label: 'Proposal Portfolio' }\n  \n  c1 --&gt; c2 --&gt; c3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\nWith the backlog of proposals, researchers can identify the unanswered research questions that are of highest priority to the state. Researchers select the highest priority items and begin the design process. This is simultaneously research design–identifying the methods and materials that will be an efficient, satisficing solution for the study–and project design identifying deliverables, roles and responsibilities, dependencies and threats, and timelines. The result of this work is a draft project charter.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  d1@{ shape: doc, label: 'Proposal Portfolio'}\n  d2@{ shape: rect, label: 'OEDA Design Unit' }\n  d3@{ shape: doc, label: 'Draft Project Charter' }\n  \n  d1 --&gt; d2 --&gt; d3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsorship\nThe OEDA manager shares the draft charter with the stakeholder agencies. Recipients include the owners and stewards of the data necessary for the work as well as the likely audiences for the study’s findings and deliverables. This begins two parallel processes.\nFirst, the OEDA Integration Unit creates a Data Integration Meeting. Data owners and stewards meet with the Integration Unit to discuss the data needs for the project. If contributing agencies have their own internal processes for interagency data sharing, those can substitute for the Data Integration Meeting. The deliverable from this process is a signed Interagency Agreement, Data Use Agreement or other legally sufficient document to permit the needed data integration and uses.\nSecond, the OEDA manager seeks sponsorship from agency leadership for the project. Sponsoring agencies will be those who will be providing resources for the project: data file preparation, time with subject matter experts, time with research staff, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  e1@{ shape: doc, label: 'Draft Project Charter' }\n  e2@{ shape: rect, label: 'OEDA Integration Unit' }\n  e3@{ share: rect, label: 'Data Integration Meeting' }\n  e4@{ shape: doc, label: 'Signed agreement' }\n  e5@{ shape: procs, label: 'Program leadership' }\n  e6@{ shape: doc, label: 'Signed project charter' }\n  e7@{ shape: doc, label: 'Project portfolio' }\n  \n  e1 --&gt; e2\n  e2 --&gt; e3 --&gt; e4 --&gt; e7\n  e2 --&gt; e5 --&gt; e6 --&gt; e7\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData preparation\nWith a signed DUA agreement and project charter, data file preparation can begin. The OEDA Integration Unit makes sure agency staff have the final versions of those documents. Agency staff should have both the technical requirements for the files and the authority to disclose those files to OEDA.\nAgency staff prepare the files, and share them back to the Integration Unit. The Integration Unit brings together the data from the various sources, typically identifying the same individual across the different sources, linking records from one system to those from another.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  f1@{ shape: doc, label: 'Project portfolio' }\n  f2@{ shape: rect, label: 'OEDA Integration Unit' }\n  f3@{ shape: procs, label: 'Agency Data Staff' }\n  f4@{ shape: docs, label: 'Agency data extracts' }\n  f5@{ shape: rect, label: 'OEDA Integration Unit' }\n  f6@{ shape: doc, label: 'Integrated study data set' }\n  \n  f1 --&gt; f2 --&gt; f3 --&gt; f4 --&gt; f5 --&gt; f6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy begins\nThe analysis-ready data are now available to the relevant OEDA units: exploration, description, hypothesis testing, program evaluation, etc. The research portion of the integrated analytics project can begin.\n\n\nSymbol key\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart RL\n  a1@{ shape: stadium, label: 'stadium' }\n  a1t@{ shape: text, label: 'Start or process trigger'}\n  a2@{ shape: rect, label: 'rectangle' }\n  a2t@{ shape: text, label: 'OEDA work unit or process' }\n  a3@{shape: procs, label: 'procs' }\n  a3t@{shape: text, label: 'Multiple contacts or simultaneous processes'}\n  a4@{ shape: doc, label: 'doc' }\n  a4t@{ shape: text, label: 'Document' }\n  a5@{ shape: docs, label: 'docs' }\n  a5t@{ shape: text, label: 'Multiple files or documents' }\n\n  a1t --&gt; a1\n  a2t --&gt; a2\n  a3t --&gt; a3\n  a4t --&gt; a4\n  a5t --&gt; a5",

    "text": "This checklist is intended for visualizations before they go “in-production”, and are distributed or presented to peers, stakeholders, the public, etc. This level of scrutiny is not appropriate for early stages, exploratory data analysis.\n\n\n\nAudience: Who is the audience for this visualization: expert peers, stakeholders, general audience, etc.? This should influence complexity, jargon, annotations, etc.\nCore message: What is the single, primary insight this vis conveys? Write it in one sentence.\nData: Have you selected the minimal data necessary to support the core message?\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering: Have the data been correctly filtered for the specific message of this plot? Are you accidentally including or excluding data that could change the conclusion?\nData types: Confirm numeric, factor, and date types are correct. Are ordinal or nominal variables formatted as factors with sensible ordering: (mutate(Category = ordered(Category, levels = c('Low', 'Medium', 'High'))))?\nMissingness: Have you made a conscious decision about NA values: remove, impute, display? Note the decision and justification (if NA are not displayed) in a caption. ggplot2() often throws a warning about removing rows with missing values. Do not ignore this. Will removing rows with missing values affect your interpretation?\nOutliers: Have you investigated outliers? Are they genuine data points or errors? Decide whether to include or exclude. Note the decision and justify it in a caption or annotation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMappings: Have you sensibly mapped tibble columns to vis aesthetics?\n\nAre your most important variables mapped to the most prominent aesthetics: aes(x = col, y = col)?\nWhen the study includes an independent, quasi-independent, or predictor variable, is that mapped to aes(x = col)?\nIs the dependent variable, outcome variable, or response mapped to aes(y = col)?\nAre secondary variables mapped to aes(color = col), aes(size = col), aes(shape = col), or aes(alpha = col)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeom: Have you selected an appropriate geom for your primary insight?\n\ngeom_boxplot() for comparing two or more distributions\ngeom_line() for time series\ngeom_point() for bivariate relationships on two quantitative axes\n\nData density: For large datasets, have you addressed overplotting: geom_*(alpha = num), geom_jitter(), geom_hex(), or geom_density2d()? Alternatively, consider aggregating and reflecting overplotting with geom_*(size = num).\nRepresenting variation or uncertainty along with central tendency: If visualizing summary statistics (means, medians, etc.) have you also displayed uncertainty: e.g. geom_errorbar() or geom_ribbon() for confidence intervals, geom_boxplot() for IQR, or geom_point()/geom_jitter() to overlay the full distribution?\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis limits: When the y-axis is continuous and positive, does it include zero?\n\nscale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, upper_limit)) will remove data points outside the range (0, upper_limit). This will influence any statistical calculations, for example the IQR hinges for geom_boxplot().\ncoord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, upper_limit)) will “zoom” the visible viewport without changing statistical properties.\n\nFacet axes: Are the y-axis limits the same across facets (especially when the main message involves comparing specific y-axis values between facets)? E.g. prefer facet_grid(scales = 'fixed') to facet_grid(scales = 'free_y').\nBreaks & grids: Are axis ticks (scale_*(breaks = vec))\n\nat logical intervals? E.g. weeks for a time series, rather than every 10 days.

    "section": "",
    "text": "This checklist is intended for visualizations before they go “in-production”, and are distributed or presented to peers, stakeholders, the public, etc. This level of scrutiny is not appropriate for early stages, exploratory data analysis.\n\n\n\nAudience: Who is the audience for this visualization: expert peers, stakeholders, general audience, etc.? This should influence complexity, jargon, annotations, etc.\nCore message: What is the single, primary insight this vis conveys? Write it in one sentence.\nData: Have you selected the minimal data necessary to support the core message?\n\n\n\n\n\nFiltering: Have the data been correctly filtered for the specific message of this plot? Are you accidentally including or excluding data that could change the conclusion?\nData types: Confirm numeric, factor, and date types are correct. Are ordinal or nominal variables formatted as factors with sensible ordering: (mutate(Category = ordered(Category, levels = c('Low', 'Medium', 'High'))))?\nMissingness: Have you made a conscious decision about NA values: remove, impute, display? Note the decision and justification (if NA are not displayed) in a caption. ggplot2() often throws a warning about removing rows with missing values. Do not ignore this. Will removing rows with missing values affect your interpretation?\nOutliers: Have you investigated outliers? Are they genuine data points or errors? Decide whether to include or exclude. Note the decision and justify it in a caption or annotation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMappings: Have you sensibly mapped tibble columns to vis aesthetics?\n\nAre your most important variables mapped to the most prominent aesthetics: aes(x = col, y = col)?\nWhen the study includes an independent, quasi-independent, or predictor variable, is that mapped to aes(x = col)?\nIs the dependent variable, outcome variable, or response mapped to aes(y = col)?\nAre secondary variables mapped to aes(color = col), aes(size = col), aes(shape = col), or aes(alpha = col)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeom: Have you selected an appropriate geom for your primary insight?\n\ngeom_boxplot() for comparing two or more distributions\ngeom_line() for time series\ngeom_point() for bivariate relationships on two quantitative axes\n\nData density: For large datasets, have you addressed overplotting: geom_*(alpha = num), geom_jitter(), geom_hex(), or geom_density2d()? Alternatively, consider aggregating and reflecting overplotting with geom_*(size = num).\nRepresenting variation or uncertainty along with central tendency: If visualizing summary statistics (means, medians, etc.) have you also displayed uncertainty: e.g. geom_errorbar() or geom_ribbon() for confidence intervals, geom_boxplot() for IQR, or geom_point()/geom_jitter() to overlay the full distribution?\n\n\n\n\n\nAxis limits: When the y-axis is continuous and positive, does it include zero?\n\nscale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, upper_limit)) will remove data points outside the range (0, upper_limit). This will influence any statistical calculations, for example the IQR hinges for geom_boxplot().\ncoord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, upper_limit)) will “zoom” the visible viewport without changing statistical properties.\n\nFacet axes: Are the y-axis limits the same across facets (especially when the main message involves comparing specific y-axis values between facets)? E.g. prefer facet_grid(scales = 'fixed') to facet_grid(scales = 'free_y').\nBreaks & grids: Are axis ticks (scale_*(breaks = vec))\n\nat logical intervals? E.g. weeks for a time series, rather than every 10 days. (scale_x_date(date_breaks = '1 week', date_labels = '%W-@y'))\nor at tidy intervals, e.g. c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20) rather than c(0, 7.3, 14.6, …)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrids: Are gridlines subtle and supportive, not distracting? (theme(panel.grid.* = element_line(color = hex, linewidth = num, linetype = string)))\n\n\n\n\n\nLegends: Generally, consider removing scale legends altogether–guides(color = 'none') or theme(legend.position = 'none')–and instead directly labeling on the plot, when possible.\n\nFor instance: Consider the case of plotting a time series (say a tibble named tbl_Series), with a separate, differently colored geom_line() for each level of the variable Group using aes(color = 'Group').

This is generally because they are not designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. That is, they are not seeking findings that can be applied to populations or situations beyond those studied.\nTypical systematic uses of data that are not research include:\n\nInternal program evaluation and quality improvement efforts\nOperational activities\nInformational interviews\n\n\n\nThe proposal provides reasoning that the project is research, but does not include human subjects, so IRB review is not required\n\nHuman subject means a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research: (i) Obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens (ii) Obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information on identifiable biospecimens 45 CFR 46.102(e)\n\nOften, work with administrative data is neither the result of intervention nor interaction.\n\nIntervention includes both physical procedures by which information or biospecimens are gathered (e.g., venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or the subject’s environment that are performed for research purposes. 45 CFR 46.102(e)(2)\n\nGenerally, researchers for state agencies are not able to create randomized control trials where Oregonians’ experiences with their government are manipulated to develop strong internal validity for generalizable claims.\n\nInteraction includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject 45 CFR 46.102(e)(3)\n\nResearchers for state agencies are often working with private information.\n\nPrivate information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (e.g., a medical record). 45 CFR 46.102(e)(4)\n\nBut, researchers can often answer meaningful agency questions without using identifiable private information.\n\nIdentifiable private information is private information for which the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information. 45 CFR 46.102(e)(5)\n\nAnalyses using deidentified data, which cannot be reasonably reidentified by the investigator, are generally not considered human subjects, as individual humans can no long be connected to the attributes being studied.\nCreating analytical datasets which follow Safe Harbor Regulations is one way to ensure that the analysis does not involve human subjects.\n\n\nThe proposal meets one or more of the requirements for review by the and has received approval from that body\nAny study that meets any of the criteria below must seek review by the Public Health Institutional Review Board.\n\n• The research is sponsored by the PHD (Oregon Public Health Division) or MCHD (Multnomah County Health Department);  • The research is conducted by or under the direction of an employee or agent of PHD or MCHD in connection with his/her agency responsibilities, or using any property or facility of PHD or MCHD;  • The research involves the use of PHD or MCHD’s data;  • The research involves the use of PHD or MCHD’s non-public information to identify or contact human research subjects or prospective subjects;  • Funding for the research will be handled through PHD or MCHD, but the research will be done at another location  Public Health Institutional Review Board (p. 3)\n\n\n\nThe project is human subjects research, but provides a checklist or attestation from someone other than the investigators that the research is exempt from IRB review\nWhile the Federal HHS does not require it, they strong recommend that determinations of exempt status be conducted by individuals other than the investigators.\nFor context, the PH and MCHD Institutional Review Board requires expedited review by the Board to determine whether a protocol is exempt.\nExempt research includes (among other exemptions):\n\nResearch in educational settings involving normal educational practices 45 CFR 46.104(d)(1)\nResearch whose interactions are only educational tests or observation of public behavior 45 CFR 46.104(d)(2)\nResearch whose interventions are benign behavioral interventions 45 CFR 46.104(d)(3)\nSecondary research for which consent is not required 45 CFR 46.104(d)(4), including specifically the following\n\n\nThe research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator’s use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the purposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b);\n\nWhere the definitions for health care operations and research defined in 45 CFR 164.501 are\n\nHealth care operations means any of the following activities of the covered entity to the extent that the activities are related to covered functions: (1) Conducting quality assessment and improvement activities, including outcomes evaluation and development of clinical guidelines, provided that the obtaining of generalizable knowledge is not the primary purpose of any studies resulting from such activities; patient safety activities (as defined in 42 CFR 3.20); population-based activities relating to improving health or reducing health care costs, protocol development, case management and care coordination, contacting of health care providers and patients with information about treatment alternatives; and related functions that do not include treatment; […] (4) Conducting or arranging for medical review, legal services, and auditing functions, including fraud and abuse detection and compliance programs; (5) Business planning and development, such as conducting cost-management and planning-related analyses related to managing and operating the entity, including formulary development and administration, development or improvement of methods of payment or coverage policies;

There may be suggestions, requests, or questions voiced in Advisory Council meetings. Researchers may review academic or think tank literature. Agency researchers and subject matter experts may meet with OEDA researchers and discuss ideas. And so on.\nWhen OEDA researchers encounter ideas they work with subject matter experts to create a proposal. Proposals should be relatively quick and easy, requiring just a meeting or two and a few hours of researchers’ time to draft. Much will still be unknown about the practicality, importance, and relevance of the proposed idea. Clarity on those will emerge with the process below.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  b1@{ shape: stadium, label: 'Idea'}\n  b2@{ shape: rect, label: 'OEDA Ideation Unit' }\n  b3@{ shape: doc, label: 'Proposal'}\n  \n  b1 --&gt; b2 --&gt; b3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvisory Council Meeting\nOEDA researchers or the OEDA manager bring proposals to the council.

Researchers select the highest priority items and begin the design process.

Recipients include the owners and stewards of the data necessary for the work as well as the likely audiences for the study’s findings and deliverables. This begins two parallel processes.\nFirst, the OEDA Integration Unit creates a Data Integration Meeting. Data owners and stewards meet with the Integration Unit to discuss the data needs for the project. If contributing agencies have their own internal processes for interagency data sharing, those can substitute for the Data Integration Meeting. The deliverable from this process is a signed Interagency Agreement, or other legally sufficient document to permit the needed data integration and uses.\nSecond, the OEDA manager seeks sponsorship from agency leadership for the project. Sponsoring agencies will be those who will be providing for the project.

    "text": "Economic stability outcomes for SSP clients\nStaff scientist(s): Kathryn Iurino, PhD Phase: Research\nAbstract primary goal of this project is to develop individual- and household-level measures of both short-term and long-term economic stability for the purposes of program evaluation and informing policy decisions.\n\n\nFamily reunification among children with incarcerated parents\nStaff scientist(s): Michael Menefee, PhD Phase: Proposal ready\nAbstract This project will work with partners from Child Welfare and Oregon Department of Corrections to identify and improve practices that support family reunification for adults in custody with minor children.\n\n\nSocial support services among formerly incarcerated people\nStaff scientist(s): Michael Menefee, PhD Phase: Proposal ready\nAbstract The goal of this project is to link Medicaid enrollment + SSP records with custody data from the Oregon Department of Corrections to study access and inequities in Medicaid enrollment and social services benefit access/utilization among formerly incarcerated people. The study will also examine whether and to what extent Medicaid enrollment improves wellbeing and positive outcomes for this population. In conjunction with DOC, the study may also consider impact of social support services on short term returns to custody (e.g., 1 year, 3 years).\n\n\nSSP case management model evaluation\nStaff scientist(s): Kathryn Iurino, PhD Phase: Proposal ready\nAbstract SSP leadership is interested in formalizing a move for family coaches, away from regulation and the monitoring of families for eligibility, towards more service integration. This was a topic of a recent (12/17, 1p-5p meeting of SSP leaders, to which ORRAI was invited). To learn whether aspects of this new approach are more likely than the older approach in helping SSP and Oregonians achieve certain goals, SSP leadership is interested in an A/B test between two or more areas in Oregon, one of which represents this newer approach and one of which represents the older approach. Ideally, this work identifies key components of a family coaching logic model or its theory of change: What do family coaches do in this new model and are there artifacts of those activities captured by SSP in their source systems? What outcomes can we add as complements to federal measures in evaluating coaching success–and do relevant data exist for those? What are available, and theoretically or empirically relevant, person-level or district/branch-level matching variables, variables which can strengthen the internal validity of cause-and-effect claims? If solid data exist related to these questions they will help improve the evaluation at hand. If they do not, one deliverable from this work can be recommendations for what SSP will want to collect in the future to gather more convincing evidence in testing their ideas and implementation of those ideas.\n\n\nEntity resolution methods\nStaff scientist(s): Aaron Cochran, MPP Phase: Research\nAbstract Development of custom, open-source methods for the ad hoc linking of project-specific person information to one or more reference sources.\n\n\nBenefits simulation codebase\nStaff scientist(s): Aaron Cochran, MPP; Kathryn Iurino, PhD; Letsogile Mponwane, MPH; Marisol Caceres Lorenzo, MSS, MS; Phase: Research\nAbstract None",
