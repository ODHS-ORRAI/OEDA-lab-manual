This is generally because they are not designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge. That is, they are not seeking findings that can be applied to populations or situations beyond those studied.\nTypical systematic uses of data that are not research include:\n\nInternal program evaluation and quality improvement efforts\nOperational activities\nInformational interviews\n\n\n\nThe proposal provides reasoning that the project is research, but does not include human subjects, so IRB review is not required\n\nHuman subject means a living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research: (i) Obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens (ii) Obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information on identifiable biospecimens 45 CFR 46.102(e)\n\nOften, work with administrative data is neither the result of intervention nor interaction.\n\nIntervention includes both physical procedures by which information or biospecimens are gathered (e.g., venipuncture) and manipulations of the subject or the subject’s environment that are performed for research purposes. 45 CFR 46.102(e)(2)\n\nGenerally, researchers for state agencies are not able to create randomized control trials where Oregonians’ experiences with their government are manipulated to develop strong internal validity for generalizable claims.\n\nInteraction includes communication or interpersonal contact between investigator and subject 45 CFR 46.102(e)(3)\n\nResearchers for state agencies are often working with private information.\n\nPrivate information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which an individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by an individual and that the individual can reasonably expect will not be made public (e.g., a medical record).\n\nBut, researchers can often answer meaningful agency questions without using identifiable private inforamtion.\n\nIdentifiable private information is private information for which the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information.\n\nAnalyses using deidentified data, which cannot be reasonably reidentified by the investigator, are generally not considered human subjects, as individual humans can no long be connected to the attributes being studied.\nCreating analytical datasets which follow Safe Harbor Regulations is one way to ensure that the analysis does not involve human subjects.\n\n\nThe proposal meets one or more of the requirements for review by the and has received approval from that body\nAny study that meets any of the criteria below must seek review by the Public Health Institutional Review Board.\n\n• The research is sponsored by the PHD (Oregon Public Health Division) or MCHD (Multnomah County Health Department);  • The research is conducted by or under the direction of an employee or agent of PHD or MCHD in connection with his/her agency responsibilities, or using any property or facility of PHD or MCHD;  • The research involves the use of PHD or MCHD’s data;  • The research involves the use of PHD or MCHD’s non-public information to identify or contact human research subjects or prospective subjects;  • Funding for the research will be handled through PHD or MCHD, but the research will be done at another location  Public Health Institutional Review Board (p. 3)\n\n\n\nThe project is human subjects research, but provides a checklist or attestation from someone other than the investigators that the research is exempt from IRB review\nWhile the Federal HHS does not require it, they strong recommend that determinations of exempt status be conducted by individuals other than the investigators.\nFor context, the PH and MCHD Institutional Review Board requires expedited review by the Board to determine whether a protocol is exempt.\nExempt research includes (among other exemptions):\n\nResearch in educational settings involving normal educational practices 45 CFR 46.104(d)(1)\nResearch whose interactions are only educational tests or observation of public behavior 45 CFR 46.104(d)(2)\nResearch whose interventions are benign behavioral interventions 45 CFR 46.104(d)(3)\nSecondary research for which consent is not required 45 CFR 46.104(d)(4), including specifically the following\n\n\nThe research involves only information collection and analysis involving the investigator’s use of identifiable health information when that use is regulated under 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, for the purposes of “health care operations” or “research” as those terms are defined at 45 CFR 164.501 or for “public health activities and purposes” as described under 45 CFR 164.512(b);\n\nWhere the definitions for health care operations and research defined in 45 CFR 164.501 are\n\nHealth care operations means any of the following activities of the covered entity to the extent that the activities are related to covered functions: (1) Conducting quality assessment and improvement activities, including outcomes evaluation and development of clinical guidelines, provided that the obtaining of generalizable knowledge is not the primary purpose of any studies resulting from such activities; patient safety activities (as defined in 42 CFR 3.20); population-based activities relating to improving health or reducing health care costs, protocol development, case management and care coordination, contacting of health care providers and patients with information about treatment alternatives;

(5) Business planning and development, such as conducting cost-management and planning-related analyses related to managing and operating the entity, including formulary development and administration, development or improvement of methods of payment or coverage policies;

These will include sessions to debrief from a recent council meeting, sessions to plan for coming council meetings, sessions to create monthly progress reports for the council, etc.\nOn these dates, we will reserve the last 30 minutes for (at least) scheduled System 4 briefings, any blockers that need management or System 2 supports, and any System 3 urgent or housekeeping updates from Jason.\n\n\n\nAd hoc events\nAlso during our weekly sessions, we will occasionally schedule time requested by anyone on the team or by guests to engage the team: align on complex info that needs discussion and clarifying questions, make decisions, create products, or get to know one another better and build connection and rapport.",
