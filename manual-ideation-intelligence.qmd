## Purpose

OEDA's System 4 are the activities that help bring our attention outside our immediate context and our day-to-day work. System 4 brings us knowledge of the external environment and potential futures. These help improve the viability of OEDA, by helping us course correct our work for changing environments and to plan for the future.

The ORRAI director is an important source of System 4 intelligence for ODHS and the OEDA Advisory Council is an important source of intelligence for partner agencies. But, the economist and researchers within OEDA can also bring intelligence to the team, if they are given occasional time outside of the day-to-day work to encounter new findings, innovative ideas, and different perspectives.
