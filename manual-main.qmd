This is an early draft of the OEDA Lab Manual. This manual establishes our standard operating procedures, best practices, and resources for conducting OEDA research. It aims to

* facilitate onboarding
* streamline workflows
* reduce analysis paralysis
* ensure data security and integrity
* promote high-quality research
* support the timely and transparent delivery of insights for public benefit

In Beer's [Viable Systems Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viable_system_model),  OEDA staff work alone and in teams as autonomous System 1 units, conducting studies and projects, producing research projects. The OEDA Lab Manual will be an important System 2 support, helping OEDA's research analysts and economist work without undue intervention, with standards, guidelines, expectations, and resources.
