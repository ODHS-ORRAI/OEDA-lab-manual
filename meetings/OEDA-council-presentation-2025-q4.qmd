:::{.notes}
"Thank you all for making the time to be here. I am very excited for this council; I believe this can be a powerful catalyst for data-informed work across the state."

Make sure everyone's sound and video are working. Please feel free to use the 'raise hand' feature. Chat is a great place to drop links to resources and information, share documents, etc. If you find yourself typing a paragraph, though--consider raising your hand instead. It can be difficult to have a spoken conversation and half a dozen written conversations happening simultaneously!

"Would everyone be okay if I started a video, transcription, and enabled Copilot for this meeting?"
