Oregon Enterprise Data Analytics (OEDA) was created by the legislature to "support integration and analysis of client and customer service information across state agencies and programs [and to] provide coordination, consolidation, and clear accountability for that work" ([Legislative Fiscal Office](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/lfo/Documents/2015-17%20LAB%20Detailed%20Analysis.pdf), p. 109).

OEDA is housed within the [Oregon Department of Human Services](https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/) (ODHS). We are a shared service of ODHS and the [Oregon Health Authority](https://www.oregon.gov/oha/) (OHA).
